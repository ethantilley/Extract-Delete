## Use

To use the program, move or make the  made file and simple run. (Plan to add .exe (executable) file at a later date)

## Why

The program was inspired when going on a download spree on itch.io and having to extract all them was a pain. So I quickly wipped up this program to do it all for me.   

## Goals With This Program
- [ ] Support .7z files
- [ ] Support .rar files
- [ ] Add a .exe (executable) file
